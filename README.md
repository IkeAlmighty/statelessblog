# Stateless Blog
A stateless markdown supported blogging app.

## Concept
Stateless Blog is an implementation of an idea I heard about years ago on the radio. The app stores the contents of the page in the URL, encoded and squashed.

## Tech Stack
 - Vanilla JS
 - HTML/CSS

You can deploy it on any static webserver.
